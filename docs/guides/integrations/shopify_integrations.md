4.	After installing the app, you'll be automatically added to the Free Plan. Glancito will start syncing the following Shopify data in the background:
      a.	Store master data
      b.	Product master data, including variants
      c.	Customer data like Name, Address, marketing consent, etc..,
      d.	Order related data

With the Shopify integration successfully installed, Glancito will continually synchronize the specified data, ensuring you have the most up-to-date information in your Glancito account.
