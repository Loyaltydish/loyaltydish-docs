# Subscription


The Glancito Subscription model offers a unique benefit: the ability to pay less initially and increase your subscription as your business grows.

With Glancito's Subscription model, you have the flexibility to start with a lower subscription tier that aligns with your current needs and budget. As your business expands and your requirements evolve, you can easily scale up your subscription to accommodate your growing demands.

This model provides a cost-effective solution, allowing you to allocate resources efficiently without overcommitting to a higher-priced plan from the beginning. It enables you to optimize your spending and ensure that you pay for the features and capabilities you require at each stage of your business growth.

By subscribing to Glancito's scalable model, you can seamlessly adjust your subscription as your business flourishes, ensuring that you have the necessary tools and resources to support your expanding operations. It empowers you to effectively manage your subscription costs while maintaining a competitive edge in your industry.

**How to change subscription?**

Upon signing up, you will be automatically enrolled in the Free Plan by default. As you begin using the service and reach the subscriber or email count limit associated with the Free Plan, an email notification will be sent to remind you to consider upgrading your subscription based on your future needs.
